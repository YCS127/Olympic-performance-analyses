# 🏅 Analysis and Evolution of Olympic Performances

## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the evolution of individual and national performances using an **Olympic Games dataset**.

The study is divided into two main parts.

---

## 1️⃣ Part I: Data Cleaning

This phase consisted of preparing and reliably structuring the dataset for analysis:

* **Handling Missing and Outlier Values:** Targeted processing of missing data and correction of anomalies, taking into account the historical and sporting context of the Olympic Games.

---

## 2️⃣ Part II: Performance Analysis

The analysis of the cleaned data explores several performance axes:

### Analysis Axes:

* **Individual Performances** (athletes).
* **Performances by Gender**.
* **Performances by NOC** (National Olympic Committee).
* **Specific Focus:** Detailed analysis of the **NOC France** performances.

### ⏱️ Study of Historical Periods (NOC Analysis)

To avoid biases related to geographical and historical changes (creation/disappearance of countries), the analysis of NOC performances was segmented into three major periods:

1. **Before the Cold War.**
2. **During the Cold War.**
3. **After the Cold War.**
